# Hello-World
Just another repository.
Hi my name is alex sanchez and i want to get into web developement and programming. This is a project i've had going for a couple of months now and i see it as a way to help myself find a job and have a better opportunity to find friends and make code do cool things. my first project is going to be building a website for eaglesnestinc.org. it's a shabby website with a great cause and i really want to make the difference for this business and the people in it.
